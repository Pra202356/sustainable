            <P>In Haiti, we promote an agroforestry approach, in which multi-cropped fruit and forest trees are co-managed with the standard subsistence and cash crops farmers depend on. This approach helps to diversify the revenues of smallholders and family farmers, while ensuring that they will have access to  short-term income while the trees grow and develop. </P>
            <P>We also promote sustainable woodlot management; for better or for worse, Haiti currently depends on fuelwood. Until that changes, we promote rapid growing species that can be sustainably harvested and have a high heat value to improve the efficiency of charcoal production.</P>
