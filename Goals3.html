            <p>Our reforestation project in Peru focuses on deforested and degraded areas in the forests of the native communities Caller√≠a, Patria Nueva and Nuevo Saposoa. Thanks to the active participation of community members and the indigenous organization FECONADIC, we're working to support good health and well-being by planting trees native to the Amazon Rainforest.</p>
            <p>With an anticipated planting of 150,000 trees in 2020, this Peruvian reforestation project will sequester approximately 22lbs of carbon per tree each year.

                One of the trees included in this project is the Mulateiro. This canopy tree grows tall and straight, reaching up to 30 meters high! In traditional herbal medicine, Mulateiro bark is decocted and used to treat infected wounds, eye infections, skin spots, wrinkles, and scars.</p>
