                in all dimensions and strives to ensure basic rights and access to resources for the worldâ€™s most 
                vulnerable populations.

            <p>Participants in The International Small Group and Tree Planting Program (TIST) plant trees for many reasons. These range from increased economic stability via forest products to environmental benefits on their farms. In addition, the TIST program generates and sells carbon offsets, returning 70% of the profits directly to the farmers.
            </p>
            <p>We're proud to state that each farmer involved in the Uganda project receives an average of $3,000 in benefits in the form of fruits, nuts, medicine, apiculture, increased crop yields, and access to cookstoves, fodder, and fuelwood.</p>
