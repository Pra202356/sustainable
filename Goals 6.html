                 <P>Oregon is home to over 35 native tree species, including the iconic Douglas Fir, Oregon White Oak, Ponderosa Pine, Western Red Cedar, Pacific Willow, and Oregon Ash. Despite this, they have lost an estimated 522,000 acres of forest cover since 2000. We're working with local partners to ensure that degraded forests are restored and full ecosystems are supported--from soil to waterways to insects, birds, mammals, and people. Healthy forests provide an important source of clean water to Salmon and other sensitive species.</P>
                 <P>Our Oregon project repairs native riparian habitat and plays a vital role in water quality improvement. This will support drinking water source protection and improve infiltration to groundwater to recharge city wells.</P>
