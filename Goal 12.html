                <li>Land degradation, declining soil fertility, unsustainable water use, overfishing, and the degradation of marine environments culminate to reduce the planet's ability to supply food.</li>
                <li>The food sector accounts for around 30% of the worldâ€™s total energy consumption and around 22% of total GHG emissions.</li>
                <li>Households consume 29% of global energy and are responsible for 21% of CO2 emissions. </li>
