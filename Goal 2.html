            <p>This project, which was funded by USAID and implemented by the USFS-IP, ran from 2013-October 2018 and involved tree planting on Cocoa farms and in secondary forests. When the trees reach maturity, the farmers involved will be able to sell products like fruits, spices, and traditional medicines.</p>
            <P>Participants will also be mobilized to plant trees in their communities. School compounds, roadsides, recreational areas, and community facilities will benefit from positive impacts like beautification and carbon sequestration.</P>
